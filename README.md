## Goal
To help people lean more Chinese characters.
How?

By embedding their phonetic script of choice into the document. Then, once they know the word, just tap it, and BOOM! No more Pinyin/Zhuyin/Jyutping/Wade Gilles/Stanford (notice why I said phonetic script in the last sentence).

## Requirements
* PHP 7/5 (I use 7)
* Please use books generated from [this project](https://github.com/TTWNO/python-ERT).

## Example site
comming soon...
